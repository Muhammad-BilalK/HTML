        <h1><b>Dawood University Artificial Intelligence Department</b></h1>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science
                that enables machines to perform tasks which require
                human intelligence like vision, language translation,
                decision making, and others. Due to rapid development
                in AI techniques and their promising performance, AI in
                itself has become a broad field which is further divided
                into different branches like computer vision, natural
                language processing, speech recognition, etc. Keeping in
                mind the importance and impact of this field in various
                sectors such as health, agriculture, military, finance,
                transportation, e-commerce, etc., and an increase in
                market demand for AI experts, Dawood University has introduced Artificial Intelligence. This program has
                been meticulously designed to equip students with all the
                skills required to hone this ground-breaking technology.<br>This program provides students an in-depth
                knowledge
                of
                tools and techniques developed for either solving
                complex problems or for automating labor intensive
                tasks, which does not only enable students to write
                efficient algorithms, but also ensures sound
                mathematical foundation to work through complex AI
                algorithms and create optimized and efficient AI models.
                The curriculum for this program includes courses mainly
                related to calculus, linear algebra, probability and
                statistics, programming, data structure, algorithms,
                database, logic and reasoning, machine learning, artificial
                neural networks, reinforcement learning, computer
                vision, natural language processing, ethics, and other
                related courses. The students can also opt for a few
                courses related to applications of AI in sectors like
                bioinformatics, robotics, information security,
                autonomous vehicles and others. </p>
