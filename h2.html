    <h1><b>Dawood University Cyber Security Department</b></h1>

    <p>In today’s digital world, cyber security has become a
        critical component of every organization’s sustainability,
        security and growth strategy. With an increasing number
        of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise,
        combined with the increased deluge of highly valuable
        confidential data, the importance of cybersecurity
        continues to grow. The growing volume and
        sophistication of cyber attackers and attack techniques
        compound the problem even further. The need for
        cybersecurity professionals has been growing rapidly,
        even faster than companies can hire—and that demand
        is expected to continue. Realizing the rising demand for
        cyber security professionals, the CSIT department of NED
        University has introduced the Cyber Security program.<br>This program is designed to prepare the next generation
        of cybersecurity professionals to protect and defend
        industry, government and military data and networks. This
        well-planned program takes the student through the
        rigorous process of becoming the best cyber security
        professionals to keep organizations absolutely cybersecure. Keeping in view the nature of this critical program,
        there’s no stone left unturned in order to ensure the
        students get the best and the quality education and
        training to be able to take the adversaries head-on.
        The curriculum for this program is designed to cover the
        core knowledge areas of computer science with
        foundational cyber security concepts that will enable
        graduates to succeed in meeting the emerging cyber
        security challenges. Students will be trained in the arts
        and skills of cyber security which includes subjects on
        cryptography, computer security, network security,
        ethical hacking, secure programming, information
        security assurance, as well as network penetration and
        countermeasures.
