    <h1><b>Dawood University Computer Science Department</b></h1>

    <p>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical
        disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to practical
        disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Computer science is generally
        considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming.<br>Algorithms and data
        structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation
        and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security
        involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer
        graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers
        different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories
        of data. Humanâ€“computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and
        software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating
        systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer
        architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial
        intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving,
        decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial
        intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language
        processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.<br>So Dawood University has introduced
        Computer Science program for students, so that they can get and give advantage through today's technologies.</p><br>
